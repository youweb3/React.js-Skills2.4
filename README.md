# React.js-Skills2.4

Tasks:

1.Complete the JSX to display the company name using curly braces {}.

2.Implement the getJobMessage function:
Use an if-else statement or a ternary operator to return the appropriate message based on jobCount.
Use a template literal for the message when there are jobs available.

3.Use JSX expression to call and display the result of getJobMessage() in the paragraph tag.

4.Test your component by changing the jobCount value and observing how the displayed message changes.

Bonus Challenges:

1.Add a simple calculation in your JSX. For example, display the expected number of jobs next week by multiplying the current jobCount by 1.5.

2.Create a more complex condition in getJobMessage. For example, return different messages for 0 jobs, 1-5 jobs, and more than 5 jobs.
